anthropogenic terrestrial biome (ENVO:01000219). A laboratory Spodoptera frugiperda colony was established from field specimens collected from a maize (Zea mays) field belonging to the Tucuman National University in El Manantial locality (Lules department, Tucuman province; 495 above sea level; 26 49 50 S; 65 16 59,4 W). Collected larvae were then reared for 9 generations under controlled photoperiod, temperature and humidity conditions on an artificial diet made of white bean, essential nutrients and preservatives, without the addition of antibiotics, adapted from Murua and Virla (2003).	marine	unclassified
